here we use lifecycle option prevent destroy

when terraform command is applied, if the file is attempted to be destroyed
this lifecycle option will prevent it and make sure file isn't destroyed.


giving error like -

│ Error: Instance cannot be destroyed
│ 
│   on main.tf line 1:
│    1: resource "local_file" "pet" {
│ 
│ Resource local_file.pet has lifecycle.prevent_destroy set, but the plan calls
│ for this resource to be destroyed. To avoid this error and continue with the
│ plan, either disable lifecycle.prevent_destroy or reduce the scope of the
│ plan using the -target option.
